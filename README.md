## Purpose
Throught this project, I wanted to refresh my css skills on layouts. Here, I used <strong>flexbox</strong>(the flexible layout), a modern css layout model which provides an efficient way to arrange layouts.
Which makes the page responsive. <a href="https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html">More about layout...</a>
